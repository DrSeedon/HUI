Credits = This name of the game is no insult. It's just that at the beginning of my career as a game dev with Unity, I had a lot of problems. I created many empty projects so that at least one of them works. The names were the most terrible and terrible. Fortunately, this project turned out to be successful and I could make a game on it. And I decided to leave the name. Do not take this game seriously. I am learning to make games on Unity, and the "game" from this arises.
